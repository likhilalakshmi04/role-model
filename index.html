 <p>  <i>Keerthy Suresh</i> <u>(born 17 October 1992)</u> is an Indian actress who appears predominantly in
     Tamil, Telugu and Malayalam films. A recipient of various accolades including a National Film Award,
      three SIIMA Awards and a Filmfare Award South, Keerthy was placed in Forbes India's 30 Under 30 list 
      of 2021.[1]<br><br>Keerthy Suresh is the daughter of film producer G. Suresh Kumar and actress Menaka G. Suresh.[2]
       She began her career as a child actress in the early 2000s and returned to films after studying fashion design.
        She had her first lead role in the 2013 Malayalam film Geethaanjali, for which she won SIIMA Award for Best Female Debut – Malayalam.[3]<br><br>After winning SIIMA Award for Best Female Debut  Tamil for Idhu Enna Maayam (2015),
     Keerthy went on to star in successful films such as Ring Master (2014), Nenu Sailaja (2016),
      Rajinimurugan (2016), Remo (2016), Bairavaa (2017), Nenu Local (2017), Mahanati (2018), Sarkar (2018), Thaanaa Serndha Koottam (2018), Penguin (2020), Miss India (2021),
       Good Luck Sakhi (2022) and Sarkaru Vaari Paata (2022). Keerthy received the Filmfare Award for Best Actress – Telugu nomination for Nenu Sailaja and Mahanati,
        winning for the latter, which also fetched her the National Film Award for Best Actress.<br><br>In 2015, Keerthy accepted her first projects outside of Malayalam and signed on to appear in several Tamil film projects simultaneously.
     Her first film release was A. L. Vijay's romantic comedy Idhu Enna Maayam (2015), opposite Vikram Prabhu, though the film did not perform
      well at the box office.[21] Her busy schedule throughout 2015 meant that she had to opt out of films which she had already started working on,
       including Krishna's Maane Thaene Paeye and Deekay's Kavalai Vendam, in order to accommodate bigger projects.[22] She consequently worked on two films with
        Sivakarthikeyan in quick succession, Rajinimurugan and Remo, while also playing the lead role in Prabhu Solomon's Thodari, alongside Dhanush.[23]
